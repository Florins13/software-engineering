# Software Engineering

The comprehensive approach to software development involves designing and implementing a computer application with a focus on systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable methodologies. The process encompasses various phases, starting with thorough [requirements specification](./Requirements%20specification/Specification_requirements.pdf), including a [vision document](./Project%20Vision/Vision_Document.pdf), a detailed use case model, supplementary specifications, and a glossary. The [logical architecture](./UML%20Diagrams/Logical_architecture_diagrams.pdf) is built upon a domain model, use case realization, architecture of mechanisms, and an overall solution architecture. [Detailed architecture](./UML%20Diagrams/Detailed_architecture_diagrams.pdf) planning covers implementation aspects, such as dynamics modeling, parts and mechanisms details, test architecture, and application deployment. Implementation involves creating a domain validation test prototype and an applicational prototype, testing multiple use cases, and delivering source code with executable test scripts. The application prototype further implements presentation and resource access mechanisms, expanding on the test prototype, and can be seen here [here](./uab-app/README.md).

This project was done during a semester in the software engineering class at Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa. The requirements and topics addressed can be seen [here](./ES-project-requirements-en.pdf)
